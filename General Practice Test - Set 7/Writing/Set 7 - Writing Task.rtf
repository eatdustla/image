\pard\pardeftab720\sa200\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb5 I am writing this email to you in order to inform you complaints I have and advise you the possible solutions so that the same complaints would not bother you. Here's what had happened:\cb1 \
\cb5 While checking my mailbox as usual, there was an advertisement about the opening of a new department store. It appeared that there were some of items such as dress shirts, headphones and pairs of jeans that were on sale. Being convinced by the advertisement, with a joy of expectation of obtaining desirable items at such low prices, I came to your department store. However, it took only half an hour for me to realize that the items were not available anymore.\cb1 \
\cb5 I am uncertain whether the items were unexpectedly sold out or the advertisement wrongly informed the potential customers, no matter what the reason is, I am not pleased that I went to your store without any reasons. On top of that I wasted my time.\cb1 \
\cb5 It may be understandable that this happened since it's a new store, but I would suggest that you improve inventory management strategy.

\cf2 \cb5 Dear Store Manager,\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa200\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb5 I recently received an advertisement regarding the opening of your new department store. The advertisement highlighted many of the special low prices that were on offer and therefore managed to entice me to the store with the chance to take advantage of these special offers.\cb1 \
\cb5 However, upon my arrival, I could not find any of the advertised items that I was interested in. I found this to be very disappointing as I was especially looking forward to purchasing the new J.Crew blazer mentioned in your advert.\cb1 \
\cb5 Not only that, but several smaller items such as socks and underwear which were mentioned in the advert, were unavailable. I enquired with a sales associate, who informed me that they had received limited stock of sale items, and therefore all of the goods had sold out straight away.\cb1 \
\cb5 I feel that it was your duty as Store Manager to ensure sufficient stock was available, knowing that an advertisement would generate significant interest from customers. I request that you honour the advertised sale price when more stock becomes available or provide me with a gift voucher to purchase a full priced item at a cheaper rate.\cb1 \
\cb5 Yours faithfully,\cb1 \

\cf2 \cb5 Your apartment manager is surveying your opinion about people using barbecues on their apartment balconies. The apartment balconies are small. Some residents think that because barbecues can cause smoke and catch fire, they should not be allowed. However, others think that using barbecues should be allowed because people like to enjoy summer food at their home. Your manager asked you to complete an opinion survey. \

\f0 \cf2 \cb5 Dear manager.\cb1 \
\cb5 Hello my name is Rafael Berlioz and I reside in the apartment 212 of your building. thanks for take a minutes and ask me about to use barbecues on the apartment balconies.\cb1 \
\cb5 Well I believe to use the barbecues on the balconies is good idea for use, especially in the summer time. We have only the summer for spend the time out with the family and friends for making delicious barbecues at the balconies, the rest of the year is very cold and we can't use the barbecues you know that right, I ask to some neighbours about this question, and all was agree about to use the barbecues, they does not found any problem about that, and looks like happily about the summer time is coming, Offaly you take my opinion and share the news to all the residents here.\cb1 \
\cb5 thank you so much for take your time and read my letter.\cb1 \

\f0 \cf2 \cb5 Many people enjoy having barbecues food on their apartment balconies during the summer time. However, in my own opinion, it is not a good idea to allow using barbecues on our apartment balconies. I disagree about it for three main reasons, the size of the balconies, the dangerous of catching fire, and the smell it caused. \cf2 \cb1 \
\
\cf2 \cb5 As our apartment is very old style and has small balconies, there is very limited space for the barbecue grille and food. It will be crowed for a group of people using barbecues and they may get hurt easily if they do not pay attention when they turn around. Other than get hurt, catching fire may be one of the potential dangerous as well. Things close by the grille may get burnt easily. Besides, each balcony is very close to its neighbours', the smell of the food may spread out and some may find the smell disgusting. It is also hard to clean and remove the smell once it is absorbed and spread. \cf2 \cb1 \
\
\cf2 \cb5 I do hope the apartment manager can collect all the surveys and take a good consideration before any decision made.

\f0 \cf2 \cb5 I think that residents should not be allowed to use barbecues on their balconies. The small balcony is not suited to accommodate large grills, and so smaller coal or wood burning barbecues would have to be used. Improper use of coal or wood burning barbecues can lead to fires. These fires would affect not just the apartment in question but also apartments immediate neighbours. All barbecues are also susceptible to grease fires which can spread rapidly when not suppressed in a quick and efficient fashion. Barbecues also pose a health risk to people allergic to smoke such as asthma patients. \cf2 \cb1 \
\
\cf2 \cb5 For people wishing to enjoy summer food there is always the possibility of utilizing the shared public barbecue grills at the base of the building. This in addition to allowing for more space and utilization of the balcony will ensure that the smoke from the barbecue will not bother the building residents. The shared communal barbecues provide the opportunity to meet and interact with your neighbours and would be an ideal solution that would cater to barbecue needs of the residents while prioritizing their safety. Thank you.\cf2 \cb6 \
